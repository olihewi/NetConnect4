# Instructions

The game that has been developed is Connect Four. The game comes with a couple of additional game modes such as Pop-Out & Connect Five.
In this section, we will explain how the clients are able to setup a game and connect with each other or play against the A.I. 
To start off have one player launch the server. Once the server has been launched the host should than provide the oponent their IP. This would allow for the players to connect to the lobby. Once the players have both inserted their names and the IP(host not required to). They will be send to the lobby screen if a connection was made. 

Inside the lobby scene the players are able to change their chips colour and select what gamemode they would like to play. Once both players have readied up then they will be taken into the game scene.

Inside the game scene the players will both have a turn each, where they are able to place a chip into the board. Achieving a line of chips equal to the defined number to win (usually 4) in horizontal, vertical or diagonal directions would trigger the win condition depending on which player has achieved it. Once one of the players has won, they will be taken to the win scene. In the win scene the players are able to exit to the title screen, replay the game or return to the lobby to make changes.
If only one player is connected and they ready-up, than they will be facing the A.I. Once the A.I defeats the player or vice versa the same scenario would be executed.
